If your request is &lsquo;manifestly unfounded or excessive&rsquo; (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs in responding.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">We will respond to your subject access request within 28 days and no longer than one month after receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time.
