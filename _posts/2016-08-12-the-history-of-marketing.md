It's a great way to know our local community better. No minimum commitment and expenses paid.

Would you like to become a Volunteer?

If you would like to help people in the community of Chinnor, and its surrounding villages, and are interested in joining our Good Neighbour Scheme Volunteers please contact us to find out more. We’d be delighted to hear from you.

We are very grateful to our volunteers for giving up their time to help us, and we do not expect them to be out of pocket as a result; for example, if you help in providing transport you can claim 40p per mile to cover expenses.

Our volunteers love what they do, and as one of them said “You meet some lovely people, and it’s great to be able to help them, but you’re not tied to specific days or times, you can do what you want and when it suits you, plus you’re not letting people down when you are not available because of holidays, etc”.

We are extremely fortunate to have such a lively and involved community in the Chinnor area. The Chinnor Good Neighbour Scheme is an integral part of this community spirit. Our volunteers are dedicated and committed to helping local people.

The Chinnor Good Neighbour Scheme is run and co-ordinated by volunteers. Scheme Administration support is at the Parish Council Office on Station Road in Chinnor.

Applying to be a Volunteer

As part of the application process all volunteers have to agree to undertake a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check, previously known as a Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check.

So if you wish to join us then contact us for more information and/or have a look at our Volunteer Handbook please click here CGNS Volunteer Handbook to download the PDF

If you want to proceed then complete a Volunteer Application Form (Volunteer Application.pdf) and arrange to see Liz Folley at Chinnor Parish Council Office. You will need two passport sized photographs of yourself, and be given a DBS form and forms relevant to volunteer driving if that is how you wish to help.

Our volunteers help to keep this service operating. By joining the team, you could help out in a number of different ways.

Volunteers can help in one or more of the following sections:-
Duty Officers – process the telephone requests and find a suitable volunteer for the client. The Duty Officers work from home and are usually on duty - one day per month, their office documentation and stationery is portable and they transfer it to the next day’s Duty Officer after office hours. You can read about a duty officer's typical day.
Bag Movers – kindly transfer the bags for those Duty Officers who are unable to transfer the bags themselves. Usually about 14 transfers required each - month, therefore frequency for each volunteer is about once every other month.
Transport – volunteers use their own cars to transport clients usually in and around St Albans, but sometimes further afield. About half of the - journeys involve taking clients to hospital appointments, a quarter are social e.g. family visits, shopping expeditions and community centres, the - remainder are classified as medical, i.e. doctors surgeries, dentists, opticians, clinics etc.
Regular Shopping – volunteers provide help with shopping, relieve carers and collect prescriptions usually for those clients who are housebound.
Practical Help – volunteers handle heavier jobs around the home, e.g. moving furniture, minor repairs, decorating and gardening.
Befriending – volunteers visit the elderly in their own homes about once a week, to provide companionship and a chat when needed.
Disclosure & Barring Service Checks
New Drivers, Befrienders and Regular Shopping volunteers are required to have a DBS check. This is administered through Care Check Limited. Further information given by the relevant Section Leader.
