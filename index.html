				<h2><strong>What is the Rural North West Peterborough Good Neighbours Scheme?</strong></h2>

						<p>We are a community-based charity that harnesses the skills and goodwill of local volunteers to help vulnerable people of all ages in Ailsworth, Ashton, Bainton, Castor and Glinton, where friends and family are unable to do so. <p>We can help with shopping, collecting prescriptions, providing transport to appointments, doing small one-off jobs around the house and garden or just popping round for a coffee and a chat.<p>
						So if you think we might be able to help you in any way then click on <a href="/help-me"> How Can We Help You </a> at the top of this page.</p>
